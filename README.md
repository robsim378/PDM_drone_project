## Setup instructions
1. Make sure you have Conda up and running on your system. If not, follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)
2. In a separate directory from this project, clone [gym-pybullet-drones](https://github.com/utiasDSL/gym-pybullet-drones) and follow the installation instructions there.
3. Clone this repository

If successful, you should be able to run the following commands:
```bash
cd src
python3 test.py
